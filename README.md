# Mattermost Mobile (unreleased) 

**Supported Server Versions:** 3.8+

This is an unreleased project for replacing the Mattermost iOS and Android apps with new mobile apps using React Native and Redux. The project is not yet stable, and the instructions are for internal use currently (i.e. probably out-of-date until we stablize). 

We'll post updates to our [Forums](http://forum.mattermost.org/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mattermosthq) when we're ready to bring in more community contributors. 

[Our early roadmap was discussed on the Mattermost forums in October 2016](http://forum.mattermost.org/t/roadmap-for-next-generation-mobile-apps-in-react-native/2339) and we'll have more updates as the project evolves. Priorities are shifting so please only use the dates in the post as a highly approximate guide. 

Mattermost is an open source Slack-alternative used by thousands of companies around the world in 11 languages. Learn more at https://mattermost.com.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**How is data handled on mobile devices after a user account is deactivated?**

App data is wiped from the device when a user logs out of the app. If the user is logged in when the account is deactivated, then within one minute the system logs the user out, and as a result all app data is wiped from the device.
